# dots
all my dots!

idea to manage dot files in github comes from [DistroTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBoLDpTWVOM)

best way to clone **before fish** is installed:
```sh
git clone --bare http://github.com/gabrieldiaziv/dots $HOME/dots
git --git-dir=$HOME/dots/ --work-tree=$HOME checkout
```

if theres issues with files that would be replaced:
```sh
mkdir -p .config-backup && \
git --git-dir=$HOME/dots/ --work-tree=$HOME checkout 2>&1 | egrep "\s+\." | awk {'print $1'} | \
xargs -I{} mv {} .config-backup/{}
```
